# retro-futuristic-clock

A retro-futuristic clock built with Bevy's Gizmos. Useful as a beginner project
for Bevy and/or Rust. Gizmos are minimalist, but are a nice entrypoint. If you 
have 15 minutes or so, you should watch the [video explaining how the code works].


Uses the `chrono` crate for calculating the time, rather than `bevy::time`.
`bevy::time` relates to game time.
